            <h2>What is a Demat Account?</h2>
            <p>
                Demat Account or Dematerialisation Account is used to electronically store your investments like Shares, Mutual Funds, ETFs, Bonds,
                Government securities etc without any paperwork.
                <br />
                Initially, stocks and shares used to be exchanged via physical receipts called certificates. This included lengthy paperwork and took up a
                lot of time. To counter this and to take advantage of an electronic trading platform which was gaining traction in West and the Asian Markets,
                the process of dematerialisation (demat) of shares was initiated in 1996. Physical share certificates were
                converted into electronic form securities of equivalent number and price and
                were credited to the investor's demat account. Thus, the advent of trading commenced this way.

                            <h4>Facilities Offered by a Demat Account</h4>
                            <small>Demat account opening offers a wide range of facilities for the investor. Let us look at a few of them below:</small>
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                • <strong>Transfer of Investments:</strong> A demat account aids the transfer of shares of an investor. By filling in a Delivery Instruction Slip ( DIS ) with all the relevant investor specifics, it enables an effortless transfer of shares. However, it is not only limited to shares, but various investments or security holding can also be transferred through such an account.
                                <br />
                                • <strong>Dematerialisation and Rematerialisation:</strong> A demat account assists the conversion of securities into different formats easily. By instructing your DP (depository participant) for dematerialisation, to carry out the formalities to convert the physical share certificate into an electronic form. On the other hand, the investor can get their electronic security holding converted back to the physical form via the process of Rematerialization, wherein an RRF - Remat Request form is to be filled in by the DP.
                                <br />
                                • <strong>Loan Facility:</strong> the securities held in the account can provide the investors with their exact and detailed holding to enable them to apply for a loan from a bank or financial institution. The securities can be provided as collateral towards the loan.
                                <br />
                                • <strong>Corporate Actions:</strong> Such accounts assist the investor in tracking and maintaining their securities. This is specifically required to monitor split of any equity shares, bonus issues or any other action taken by the companies for their shareholders. These are directly updated in the account.
                                <br />
                                • <strong>Freezing your demat account:</strong> Investors are provided with the option to freeze their accounts for a specific period or as per requirement. At times this is undertaken to prevent unexpected activities in the account. However, to avail this facility a particular amount of shares should be present in the investor's account.
                                <br />
                                • <strong>Speed E- facility:</strong> NSDL has provided an electronic facility for their investors to complete a transaction through the submission of an e-slip which is then sent to their DP.

                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>• Address proof:

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>You will get a list of documents required for account opening from the DP. Make sure you provide the correct documents
                                            to avoid your application getting rejected.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Charges:</strong> There is an array of fees collected by the broker, ranging from taxes levied by SEBI to operational fees.
                                            Charges are a crucial metric to select the right broking house since these are additional costs you would need to bear
                                            along with capital fund investment.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Linking Demat:</strong> You need a trading account, linked to your Demat, to carry out trading. You can have trading and
                                            Demat accounts with separate broking houses. But it adds to the process requirement of transferring scrips from one account
                                            to another and transaction time. For faster and more seamless transactions, you may open both the accounts with the same broker.</li>
                                        <li><strong>File nomination:</strong> Registering nominee to your Demat saves a lot of time and hassle in the future. It is an important
                                            step that we often ignore. However, we suggest naming a nominee for your account while opening the Demat.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <strong>Account types:</strong> Demat account can take different forms, just like a bank account. You can open a joint Demat account, or in the name of a corporation, multiple accounts, and even in the name of a minor. However, a minor's Demat account will need a guardian to operate the account.

                                <strong>Transaction Charges:</strong> Opening a Demat account comes with its fair share of charges which would involve an annual maintenance fee, a transaction fee or commission for every transaction carried out by the DP. Additionally, depending on the DP a fee may be charged for dematerialisation of the shares. But on the brighter side, there are no mandates to sustain a minimum balance. Such accounts can be opened without holding any securities.
