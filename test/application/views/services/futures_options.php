            <h2>What is a derivatives trading account?</h2>
            <p>
                Derivatives trading (Futures & Options) involves buying or selling derivative products. The idea is to hedge portfolio risks and make substantial
                gains from price volatility by paying nominal margins. They are called derivatives because they derive their value from underlying assets like equity,
                bonds, currency or commodities. To trade in derivatives, you will need an F&O account.

                        <p>What is an options and futures contract?</p>
                        <p> Though both futures and options are derivatives of underlying asset classes, they’re different. The primary one
                            being, an option is a right (and NOT an obligation) to buy or sell an underlying asset, at pre-determined
                            prices. A futures contract, on the other hand, is an obligation on the part of buyers and sellers
                            to execute the trade at pre-decided prices on the date mutually agreed.</p>
                        <p>Example of futures trading</p>
                        <p> For instance, you buy one-month equity contracts of ABC Company with your futures account at Rs.400 per share. On the contract expiry date, if the share price goes up to Rs. 450, you end up making a decent profit.
