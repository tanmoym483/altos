                        Angel One Limited's digital-first approach is something that has always been deeply rooted in our hearts.
                        Since its inception, Angel One Limited has effectively leveraged technology to deliver its products,
                        services and class-leading experiences to a growing client base. And as one of the key trailblazers
                        in the stockbroking industry, Angel One Limited has been leading from the front for over two decades.
                        Over the years, they have witnessed first-hand the rise of the new era of young investors. In fact,
                        Angel One Limited is one of the first broking houses to recognize the growing expectations of this
                        set of investors, moving beyond mere mutual fund investing and stock trading and into the realm of
                        rule-based investment trading. This leads us to Angel One.
                        <br />
                        With the Angel One brand, the company is transforming into a new-age fintech platform
                        of enabling millennials from new-age India to fulfill their financial dreams. Angel One
                        Limited will continue to digitally onboard customers, providing the most sophisticated
                        solutions at the convenience of a mobile tap.

                        Over the years, Angel One Limited grew weaker and stronger, and consequently tapped new geographies
                        and added millions of new customers including tier-2 and tier-3 cities. No wonder our company is India's
                        largest listed retail broking house in terms of active clients on NSE as on December 31, 2021.
