        <h2>Open Equity Trading Account</h2>
        <p>
          To grow wealth exponentially over a relatively shorter time takes knowledge and experience. Most investors prefer trading in the stock markets 
          to achieve these ends. However, as we said before, you need to be an expert. Of course, guidance and analyses from seasoned market 
          experts are essential too. Equity trading involves buying and selling of shares of companies in the stock market. You can do this with an equity 
          trading account.
          <br/>

                <h4>What is an equity account?</h4>
                <p>
                  As we said before, you need an equity trading account to be able to trade. This account enables you to buy and sell shares of companies and also hold them in a dematerialised format.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  Equity account opening involves signing up for trading and demat accounts. These two will then get linked to your savings bank account 
                  (with your consent) for transferring funds. Thanks to a fully digitised process, brokerage firms like Angel One provide 
                  integrated platforms for opening equity accounts.

                <h4>Trading account</h4>
                <p>
                  A trading account lets you buy and sell securities on the stock exchange. Here you get a unique trading identification number (id).
                  <br>
                  <strong> account</strong>
                  <br/>
                  A Demat account is like a digital locker for the securities you buy as it holds the securities in a paperless (dematerialised) format. 
                  It has replaced the physical storing of share certificates. You can say it’s a bank account to park your investments.
                  <br/>
                  The purpose of a Demat account is to hold securities purchased through a trading account and payments are done through the linked bank account.
                  <br/>
                  This distinction is vital in the equity online account opening process and even if you choose to submit physical documents.
