            <h2>Commodity trading account</h2>
            <p>
                To trade in commodities, you need to open a commodity trading account with a broker.
                This type of trading is essentially in futures and options of products like agriculture (wheat, cotton, etc.), minerals
                (petroleum), and precious metals (gold, silver, etc.).
                <br />
                <strong>Commodity futures and options</strong>
                Before you open a commodity account, you need to know a little bit about derivatives. There are two main types of products – futures and options.
                Futures contracts give you the right to purchase or sell a certain amount of a particular commodity at a predetermined date in the future.
                Options give you the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific commodity at a predetermined price in the future.
                <br />
                Futures and options are traded on commodity exchanges like Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) and National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX).
                Only members (brokers) are allowed to trade on these exchange, so you need to open commodity trading account with a broker like Angel One.
